Hello, User Of KeyEnd.

So Just A Few Notes.

1) If You Want To Bootup The VM (Because Why Wouldn't You), Double-Click The File Called "bootup.bat"
2) You Can Not Currently Change Directory, As The Architecute Of The System Just Doesn't Allow It.
3) When You Bootup If You Have No Idea What To Do, Type "help" For A List Of Commands
